### Project Description
Students everywhere face the devastating challenge of coming up with creative excuses for late assignments ‚Äî because obviously, ‚Äúmy dog ate it‚Äù is just too mainstream. Without a reliable source of absurd yet believable excuses, procrastinators suffer in silence, struggling to keep their stories fresh and entertaining!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We‚Äôve built the ultimate Excuse Generator ‚Äî a magical button that spits out the weirdest, funniest, and most unbelievable reasons for your assignment‚Äôs tardiness. Whether your WiFi decided to switch colleges or a time-traveling goat ate your homework, our app has got your back with excuses so wild, even your professor might laugh!
